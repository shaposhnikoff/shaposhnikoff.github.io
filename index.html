<li><p>Create and maintain full stack of Terraform infrastructure in AWS - creating infrastructure for</p></li>
<li><p>ECS (Fargate, task definitions and service descriptions)<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>ELB (Application LB, target groups for set of Docker containers)<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>Hashicorp Packer provision containers for AWS (creating custom AMI, upload it to S3, deploy to EC2)</p></li>
<li><p>Maintenance of project infrastructure (CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), Help with creating Dockerfiles, knowledge sharing)</p></li>
<li><p>Create and maintain Kubernetes cluster that work as Jenkins slave runner for needs of Development team (Kubernetes run specific pods, for example with specific version of Node.js and this allows developers to run various environments to getting the best results). We use Kubernetes cluster for these purposes because we can start and stop pods in cluster very quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated build and deployment process with Gitlab CI, eliminating 80% of manual work.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated deployments for 200+ cloud servers (EC2/ECS) using Ansible, Terraform and Bash.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying configuration changes using Ansible, AWS, Terraform, Packer, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintenance of K8S cluster, creating HELM charts for Jenkins deployed microservices via Jenkins jobs, configuration, and patch management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All this infrastructure are developed to use in separate environments, so, to prepare it to use in dev, or stage, or prod we need to change only AWS Network settings (VPC, SG, Subnets) and we ready to apply this configuration to another account.</p>
<p>I’m also spended a 6 month as a contractor in Google (Seattle), works as Release Engineer in a Google Cloud Frontend Team. Used technologies - Python :)</p>
