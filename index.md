### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
#### SoftServe – Senior DevOps Engineer
Jan 2023 – Present

Implemented automated resource hibernation system (scheduling, state management, monitoring), significantly lowering idle infrastructure costs.

Designed and tested API validation framework for HR-related processes, ensuring secure, consistent, and automated verification across large-scale user datasets.

Migrated and optimized CI/CD pipelines (GitLab → GitHub Actions) using a custom AI agent, reducing deployment time by 40% and eliminating manual migration overhead.

Built AI-assisted monitoring dashboards in Grafana/Prometheus, where a custom agent correlates anomalies and alerts, cutting incident response time by 35%.

Developed custom AI agents (OpenAI + LangChain) for repetitive DevOps workflows — infrastructure validation, documentation generation, incident troubleshooting.

Optimized multi-cloud infrastructure (Azure + AWS) with Terraform & Ansible, supported by an AI-driven cost analysis agent, reducing operational expenses by up to 20%.
