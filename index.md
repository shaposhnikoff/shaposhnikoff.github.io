Always aiming for zero downtime and those lovely smooth deployments.

My key expertise includes design and implementation of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment using Jenkins, Gitlab CI/CD, Argo CD/CD, Git, Docker, Vagrant, Ansible, and AWS/EC2.

I also have considerable skills in automating deployments of Java applications with Tomcat, and AWS, as well as almost 20 years of experience in UNIX/Linux and Middleware/Application Server administration.

Being a self-motivated, responsible, and sociable team player, I can use my technical expertise to implement quality solutions and bring added value.

Detailed technical knowledge and hands-on experience of Build Engineering, Configuration Management and DevOps Engineering.

Main responsibilities on the project 
   
   *  Create and maintain fully automated CI/CD pipelines for code deployment using Jenkins/Terraform/Ansible/Docker 
   *  Prepare and maintain EC2 Fleet cloud instances , which launches EC2 Spot or On Demand instances as worker nodes 
   	for Jenkins CI server, automatically scaling the capacity with the load.

   *  Create and maintain Terraform infrastructure for all ECS/ECR/Lambda/ALB types of AWS infrastructure of a project
   
   *  Centralised Monitirong system ( migrated is about 8000 nodes from NewRelic to Datadog  ) 

   *  Reduced costs by ~$3,000 each month by eliminating unnecessary servers and consolidating databases
   
   *  Improving developer workflow, increasing scalability, and optimizing speed.
   
   *  Miscellaneous Docker/Ansible/Python work

### Grid Dynamics
#### Senior Systems Engineer
######  Dec,2017 -Dec,2020
######  IOT && ECS project for NDA company


Main responsibilities on the project 

   * AWS (EC2, SNS, SQS, IoT Core, Lambda, S3, Route 53, ACM, WAF, KMS, DynamoDB, ECS Fargate, ECR, Cognito, CodeBuild), Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Azure Devops, Jenkins - pipelines, releases, AWS integration (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy)
   * Create and maintain full stack of Terraform infrastructure in AWS - creating infrastructure for 
   * ECS (Fargate, task definitions and service descriptions)  
   * ELB (Application LB, target groups for set of Docker containers)  
   * ECR (Automated creation Docker repo from CI/CD pipelines) 
   * ACM (Automated provision of LetsEncrypt / Other types of certs) 
   * VPC (Subnets, Nat GW, IGW) 
   * Route53, SNS, SQS, Lambda
   * Hashicorp Packer provision containers for AWS (creating custom AMI, upload it to S3, deploy to EC2)
   * Maintenance of project infrastructure (CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), Help with creating Dockerfiles, knowledge sharing)
   * Create and maintain Kubernetes cluster that work as Jenkins slave runner for needs of Development team (Kubernetes run specific pods, for example with specific version of Node.js and this allows developers to run various environments to getting the best results). We use Kubernetes cluster for these purposes because we can start and stop pods in cluster very quickly.

   * Automated build and deployment process with Gitlab CI, eliminating 80% of manual work.
   * Automated deployments for 200+ cloud servers (EC2/ECS) using Ansible, Terraform and Bash.
   * Applying configuration changes using Ansible, AWS, Terraform, Packer, etc.
   * Maintenance of K8S cluster, creating HELM charts for Jenkins deployed microservices via Jenkins jobs, configuration, and patch management.

All this infrastructure are developed to use in separate environments, so, to prepare it to use in dev, or stage, or prod we need to change only AWS Network settings (VPC, SG, Subnets) and we ready to apply this configuration to another account.


I'm also spended a 6 month as a contractor in Google (Seattle), works as Release Engineer in a Google Cloud Frontend Team.
Used technologies - Python :)
