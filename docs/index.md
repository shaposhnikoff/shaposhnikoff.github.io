## Professional Summary
Senior DevOps/Platform & Data Engineer with 20+ years of experience designing and operating cloud infrastructure and data-adjacent platforms across AWS and Azure. Strong focus on Python-driven automation, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible), CI/CD standardization, cost governance, and observability (Prometheus/Grafana). Delivered measurable improvements in cloud spend, delivery lead time, and incident triage by automating lifecycle management and reducing manual operational overhead.  
LLM/AI tooling experience used for engineering productivity (documentation, validation, migration assistance) with security-minded handling (sanitized inputs, no secrets in prompts, audit-friendly outputs).

## Key Skills
- Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, EMR, Glue, Cost Explorer), Azure (Compute, Networking, PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Key Vault)
- IaC & Automation: Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible, Python, Bash
- Containers & GitOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Argo CD, OCI registries (Harbor/JFrog)
- CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Tekton
- Observability & Security: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, ELK, Dynatrace, Trivy, policy checks (e.g., IaC scanning)
- Data Platforms: Databricks, Airflow, Snowflake; ETL/ELT concepts, data quality validation patterns
- Engineering Practices: secure CI/CD, blue-green/rolling deploys, incident response, runbooks, testing (Pytest), API validation frameworks

## Professional Experience

### SoftServe — Senior DevOps Engineer
Jan 2023 – Present

Cost & Platform Automation
- Built automated resource hibernation/scheduling for non-production workloads (state management + safety checks), reducing idle cloud spend by ~20% (baseline/period available upon request).
- Standardized and hardened IaC workflows (Terraform/Ansible), improving repeatability and reducing drift across multi-subscription/multi-account environments.

CI/CD & Delivery Acceleration
- Led GitLab → GitHub Actions migration with reusable workflows and policy gates; improved delivery lead time by ~40% and reduced manual pipeline maintenance overhead (baseline/period available upon request).
- Implemented migration tooling and conventions to reduce per-repo onboarding time and ensure consistency.

Observability & Incident Response
- Improved incident triage via Prometheus/Grafana dashboarding and alert signal correlation; reduced MTTR by ~35% (baseline/period available upon request).

Data & Governance
- Designed and implemented cross-cloud storage governance reporting (inventory + posture signals + normalized schema), producing stakeholder-ready CSV/tabular outputs used for remediation planning and cost/governance decisions.

Realized Engineering Projects
- AI-assisted GitLab CI → GitHub Actions converter (Anthropic Claude): converts `.gitlab-ci.yml` into `.github/workflows/*.yml`, generates conversion notes (mappings, assumptions, gaps), supports repository auto-discovery; credential handling via environment variables.
- kvpass: CLI password manager backed by Azure Key Vault, providing a “pass-like” workflow with centralized governance and access control.

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2), Terraform, Ansible, AWS, Azure, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Tekton, Prometheus, Grafana, Databricks, Airflow, Snowflake, Pytest

### Zoolatec — Senior DevOps Engineer
Dec 2020 – Jan 2023

- Scaled data operations on AWS using EMR/Glue; improved IAM structure and operational reliability for data workloads.
- Built multi-account infrastructure with Terragrunt, enabling consistent environment provisioning and reducing manual setup.
- Implemented GitOps practices with Kubernetes/Helm/Argo CD for workload management and safer deployments.
- Automated migration/import from ClickOps into IaC to reduce drift and increase auditability.
- Expanded monitoring and logging with Prometheus/Grafana and ELK to improve visibility and alerting quality.

### Grid Dynamics — Senior DevOps Engineer
Dec 2017 – Dec 2020

- Enterprise infrastructure operations and cloud migration support across multiple teams/projects.
- CI/CD reliability improvements, IaC enablement, and operational automation (details available upon request).

### EPAM Systems — Senior DevOps Engineer
Feb 2014 – Apr 2017

- Built foundational DevOps practices: automation, CI/CD, configuration management, and monitoring for production systems.
- Supported multiple delivery teams with standardized tooling and operational patterns (details available upon request).

## Selected Achievements
- Reduced operational cloud spend by up to ~20% through automated lifecycle management and governance reporting.
- Improved delivery lead time by ~40% via CI/CD migration and workflow standardization.
- Reduced MTTR by ~35% through observability improvements and better triage workflows.
- Delivered cross-cloud reporting that enabled unified governance decisions across AWS and Azure.

## Personal Technical Interests
- RF & Electronics: licensed radio amateur; digital communications experimentation.
- Embedded/IoT: ESP32/Arduino, Home Assistant integrations, custom automation and telemetry collection.
